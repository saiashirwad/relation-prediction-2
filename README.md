A Re-evaluation of Knowledge Graph Completion Methods - Zhiqing Sun et al
	* shows inappropriate evaluation methods used by recent deep-learning based SOTA methods
	* Proposes simple evaluation protocol designed to handle above problem
	* 


Check:
	* tail embeddings in model output


ToDo:
	* during evaluation (and tesing) to evaluate/test ?, r, t
		* do forward pass of model for all x, r, t where x in nodes (self loop?)
		* likewise for h, r, ?
